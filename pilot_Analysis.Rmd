# Subject statistics
First, we will determine whether IQ correlates with age in our sample. As specified in our pre-registration, here we run run a linear regression testing the effects of age on IQ. 

```{r IQ age regression and plot}
# Run linear regression testing the effects of age on IQ
ageIQ.lm <- lm(IQ ~ Age, data = subInfo) #run regression
ageIQeffectSize <- modelEffectSizes(ageIQ.lm, Print = F, Digits = 3)
ageIQsummary <-(anova(ageIQ.lm))
ageIQsummary$pEta[1] <-ageIQeffectSize$Effects[2,3]
ageIQsummary$pEta[2] <-NA
pander(ageIQsummary)

# Plot the correlations
ageIQPlot <- ggplot(subInfo, aes(x = Age, y = IQ)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", color = color2) + 
  xlab("Age") + ylab ("IQ") +
kate.theme
ageIQPlot

```
This analysis indicates that there is a significant relation between age and IQ. As such, we will run all subsequent models both with and without IQ as an interacting fixed effect to better tease apart effects of age from effects of IQ.


# Frequency task analysis
_In this section, we will run mixed effects models to determine the effects of appearance count and age on participants' accuracy and reaction time during the frequency task. For both models, we will start with the maximal random effects structure. If the models do not converge, we will remove random slopes and intercepts as specified in the pre-registration. As we preregistered, if the maximal model does not converge, we will follow the procedure laid out in Singmann & Kellen (2017) to reach convergence. They recommend first removing correlations between random slopes and random intercepts. If models stil fail to converge, they recommend removing random-effects parameters 'starting with the highest-order random effects parameter with the lowest estimated variance._

## Frequency task accuracy
First, we will ensure that all subjects responded to >10% of repeated trials, indicating that they understood the task instructions.
```{r divide freq accuracy data by old and new}
#Divide frequency data into new items and old items

#compute each subjects' accuracy
freqDataSubAcc <- freqDataRepeatedItems %>% group_by(ID) %>% summarise(meanFreqAcc = mean(acc, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% arrange(meanFreqAcc)

#print data frame to ensure all subjects responded with a reasonably high degree of accuracy
freqDataSubAcc

#scale continuous variables used in models
freqDataRepeatedItems %<>% mutate(ageScaled = scale_this(Age), appearanceCountScaled = scale_this(appearanceCount), IQScaled = scale_this(IQ))

#Memory test analysis

_In this section, we will run four mixed effects models to examine the effects of frequency condition on memory accuracy (both with and without IQ included). We will deviate from our pre-registration by only analyzing the data from the first appearance of each item during the memory test (the first 30 trials). We will follow the same procedure as with our frequency data to find the maximal random effects structure that converges._

# Relationship between strategy use and memory encoding
_Finally, we will run a regression examining the effects of strategy use on memory benefit score. We will model the effect of subject strategy recognition (a 2-level categorical variable based on participant’s response (yes/no) to our question of whether they recognized that focusing on the more-frequent animals would be a good strategy) and age on their memory benefit score._

```{r strategy memory relationship}
#create data frame that has 1 row for each subject with age, ageGroup, IQ, mem benefit score, and strategy use
stratMemData <- memDataCombined %>% select(-c(animal, paFood, memRT, memResp, memAppearanceCount, foodSide, paResp, paRT, paTrial, memGridLocation, freqCond, Vocab, MR, meanPaAcc, include, learningIndex, memAcc, freqCondFactor, ageScaled, freqCondScaled))

#find unique rows
stratMemData <- unique(stratMemData)

#scale age and IQ
stratMemData$IQScaled <- scale_this(stratMemData$IQ)
stratMemData$ageScaled <- scale_this(stratMemData$Age)
```

## Strategy use regression without IQ
```{r strategy use without IQ}
#run regression without IQ
stratMem.lm <- lm(memBenefitIndex ~ ageScaled * GeneratedStrategy, data = stratMemData)
pander(summary(stratMem.lm))

```

## Strategy use regression with IQ
```{r strategy use with IQ}
#run regression with IQ
stratMem.IQ.lm <- lm(memBenefitIndex ~ ageScaled * IQScaled * GeneratedStrategy, data = stratMemData)
pander(summary(stratMem.IQ.lm))
```

## Strategy use by age group
```{r strategy use by age group}
#look at mean strategy use per age group
stratSummaryData <- stratMemData %>% group_by(ageGroup) %>% summarise(meanStratUse = mean(as.numeric(as.character(GeneratedStrategy))))

pander(stratSummaryData)
```
