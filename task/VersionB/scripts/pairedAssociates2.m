%% PAIRED ASSOCIATES TASK %%
% In this task, participants see a card and a stamp presented on the
% screen simultaneously. Participants see instructions that tell them that
% they should try to remember which card goes with which stamp.

%Participants must press one button if the stamp is
% on the right side of the card and a different button if the stamp is on
% the left side of the card.

%% Get subject information
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input subject information
%subjectNumber = input('Enter subject number ');

%% Create data file
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
PA_filename = [int2str(subjectNumber), '_PA2.txt'];
fileID = fopen(PA_filename, 'w');

%specify file format. For this task, the data will be saved in a table with
%8 columns:
% Column 1: stamp stimulus
% Column 2: card stimulus
% Column 3: side of the screen the stamp was on - 1 for right, 2 for left
% Column 4: response
% Column 5: RT
% Column 6: trial start
% Column 7: trial end
% Column 8: trial number

formatSpec = '%s\t%s\t%f\t%d\t%d\t%d\t%d\t%f\n';
